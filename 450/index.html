<p>Since we were founded back in 2014, London’s Community Kitchen has become an important part of the communities in and across suburban London.
Our Ethos of Zero Waste and Zero Hunger is the blueprint to our entire operations, we believe it to be an absolute human right to have access to free or affordable food for the most vulnerable communities across London.</p>
 
<p>London’s Community Kitchen aims to intercept the cycle of food waste by redistributing it to food insecure households. Each week we hold a surplus food market where everyone, regardless of status and without being subjected to any checks, can access surplus food at no cost. As it stands, we feed 10,000 users a week.</p>
 
<p>At its core London’s Community Kitchen is run by the community for the community. We wish to promote cohesion and acceptance, considering this one of our most recent projects involves creating vibrant events for the borough of Harrow to celebrate our community and all that we have achieved together. We work with the most dedicated and charitable people to help ease the suffering of those we work with. Contact us to learn more about what you can do to help and become a part of the change by donating or volunteering today.</p>

<summary>Archery</summary>
<p>John Lyon directed in his will that Archery should be a compulsory part of the curriculum at the school. A competition for the Silver Arrow was held every year until 1771 when it was stopped because of crowd control issues, but the arrow still appears in Harrow School coat of arms. Since the mid-20th century, Archery has been taken up again as part of the sporting curriculum. Every year there is an annual match between Harrow School and The John Lyon School, in which we celebrate our association and membership of the wider Harrow family. To celebrate this unique sport during the Community Events, both schools are putting a historic display/competition where members of the public can enjoy seeing the boys in action shooting composite bows from 10 and 20 yards.</p>

<summary>Merrydowners Morris</summary>
<p>Founded in 1990 as a fun entry in a local Church Fete (St. Alban, North Harrow), we practised in secret as, at the time, one of the team was the vicar of the church, so you can imagine the gasps of surprise at our debut! We enjoyed the experience so much that several of the original church members are still performing. During the past 31 years we have performed across London, in France and Germany, the highlights being: The Guildhall, City of London, for the inaugural Dinner of the 1996 European football championships; representing England at The Hong Kong Chinese New Year parade in 2004; La Fetes du Gayants, Douai Pas de Calais in 2001 and 2003; Recklinghausen Germany for the annual Concert of The Akkordeonklaenge von Recklinghausen Westfallen in 2005. We took part many times in London’s New Year’s Day parade and have also appeared in a pop music video and, albeit briefly, on the BBC’s Strictly Come Dancing and also on The One Show! We were also honoured to be included in Harrow’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations and performed for HRH The Duke of Edinburgh.</p>

<summary>Roystonjax</summary>
<p>RoystonJax are a trio with a difference. They use stripped down to bass/drum backing tracks and play live guitars with fabulous three-part harmonies. It feels like a full band but one that can play at any volume in any venue!</p>

<summary>Stagecoach Harrow</summary>
<p>Stagecoach Harrow is in its 29th Year and was one of the first Stagecoach schools to open based at Rooks Heath College. Emmy Hamilton has been Principal for 15 of those years and is proud to be at the head of this energetic and creative Performing Arts School in the borough. At this event are dedicated students from Stagecoach Harrow's Dance Troupe (performing some street and musical theatre) and our 15+ year group 'Further Stages' who will be performing some of their Performance Arts Awards Exam work, based on life in 1940s. There are two other Stagecoach centres in the borough: Stagecoach Harrow on the Hill and Stagecoach Harrow Weald, all three providing quality, nurturing environments in part time performing arts lessons for our students to thrive in, from 4-19 years, with lots of opportunities for students to be themselves, develop skills and confidence, make new friends, and have a chance to shine. Professional work and West End opportunities along with added value in LAMDA lessons are also available.

<summary>St Mary's Church</summary>
<p>After listening to the bell-ringing opening the Community Day, why not climb the tower and go onto the roof (weather permitting) to see the stunning views of the Hill and London? Come and meet Elizabeth I and John Lyon, who founded the School, and other characters in costume (including the apothecary, Thomas Graham, in his Apothecary's shop) who will tell you some of the history of the School and church. Visit the church where Harrow boys worshipped before the chapel was built, including prime ministers Robert Peel and Spencer Perceval, the poet, Lord Byron, playwrite, Sheridan, and novelist, Anthony Trollope. Go on our "Monumental Connections" tour at 12 noon, visit the tomb of the oldest resident of the Hill - our Saxon lady, discover our churchyard nature trail or have a cuppa and a homemade scone at our Spire Cafe (open 11am - 6pm). All are very welcome.</p>
