## Data Transmission

_What are the directions that data can be transmitted?_
- Simplex, where data is only sent in one direction, for example from a computer to a printer.
- Half-duplex, where data is sent in both directions, but not at the same time, for example a phone conversation where both people talk at different times.
- Full-duplex, where data is sent in both directions at the same time, for example the broadband connection on a phone line.

_What are the different data transmission types?_
- Serial, where the data is sent bit by bit through a single channel.
- Parallel, where multiple bits are sent at the same time using a number of channels.

_What are the advantages 
**Advantages and disadvantages of Serial**

- **Advantages**
    - cheaper
    - fewer wires
    - less complicated transmission
- **Disadvantages**
    - takes longer to send data

**Uses of Serial** 

- USB
- firewire
- ethernet
- telephone wire
- pci-e

**Advantages and disadvantages of Parallel** 

- **Advantages**
    - faster more data sent at one
- **Disadvantages**
    - problem over long distance
    - more complicated transmission
    - more expensive because more wires

**Uses of parallel** 

- cpu connectoin
- ata/ide

### Data Transmission Modes

- there are three directions of data movement
- **Simplex =** one way  e.g. a radio
- **Duplex =** both directions **at the same time** e.g. phone
- **Half Duplex=** both direction but **one after the other**  e.g. walkie talkie

### Error Checking

**Why are they needed ?** 

- there may be errors which effect data being sent
- nobody wants data that is corrupted and cannot be sent

**Types of Error Checking** 

- Echoing back
- Check sums
- Parity Check
- ARQ

**How are parity bits are used for error detection** 

- Odd or even parity can be used
- 1 bits are counted
- Parity bit added depending on parity set
- Parity checked on receipt
- If parity bit is incorrect an error is detected

**How checksum is used for error detection** 

- Calculation performed on data
- Checksum sent with data
- Checksum recalculated after transmission
- Comparison made between checksum before and checksum after transmission
- Error detected if checksums are different

**How ARQ is used for error detection** 

- Uses acknowledgement and timeout
- Request is send requiring acknowledgement
- If no response within certain time frame data package is resent
- When data received contains an error a request is sent to resend the data
- The resend request is repeatedly send until pack is received
