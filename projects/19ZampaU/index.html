<h1>What is Pasta</h1>
<p> Italian pasta is made from ground durum wheat and water or sometimes even eggs, which makes dough. People think it was invented in Italy, but actually Marco Polo, a Venetian merchant and adventurer during the 13th century who travelled to China and remained there for 17 of those years, was inspired from the Asian noodles. He then brought them to Italy where pasta was first made. </p>
