 <div><p>There are two multiple-choice quizzes you can choose to play.</p></div>
 <div><p>Beware! This is not an easy quiz and you may not have come across all of these questions before. It will be very hard to score highly so this experience is more focused on learning new, interesting facts.</p></div>

 <h1>How do I Check Answers?</h1>
 <div><p>When you click the 'Submit Quiz' button, which you can find at the bottom of each trivia section; you will see which questions you got wrong as they will appear in <span style="color:red"> red</span>. </p></div>
 <div><p>Even lower, you will see a 'Click for Answers' button which you can press to reveal all of the correct answers in a list with the question number they correlate to in front of it.</p></div>
