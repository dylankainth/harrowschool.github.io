<summary>Traditional Dance</summary>

<p><b>Merrydowners Morris</b></p>
    <p>Founded in 1990 as a fun entry in a local Church Fete (St. Alban, North Harrow), we practiced in secret as, at the time, one of the team was the vicar of the church so you can imagine the gasps of surprise at our debut!<br><br>
        We enjoyed the experience so much that several of the original church members are still performing.<br><br>
        During the past 31 years we have performed across London, in France and  Germany, the highlights being; The Guildhall City of London for the inaugural Dinner of the 1996 European football championships; representing England at The Hong Kong Chinese New Year parade in 2004; La Fetes du Gayants, Douai Pas de Calais in 2001 and 2003; Recklinghausen Germany for the annual Concert of The Akkordeonklaenge von Recklinghausen Westfallen in 2005. <br><br>
        We took part many times in London’s New Year’s Day parade and have also appeared in a pop music video and, albeit briefly, on the BBC’s Strictly Come Dancing and also on The One Show! <br><br>
        We were also honoured to be included in Harrow’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations and performed for HRH The Duke of Edinburgh.</p>
